- You will also need to install the [Adafruit-circuitpython-ht16k33](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HT16K33)
- An [Openweathermap account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up/), but you can use the free _weather_ key for the purposes of this script.

## Instructions

Be sure to update the **[config.ini](config.ini)** file with your [Openweathermap API Key](https://openweathermap.org/api_keys/) and other details.

Then simply run `python3 rpi-clock.py`. You should see output on your [Adafruit 1.2" 7-Segment LED HT16K33 Backpack](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/1-2-inch-7-segment-backpack/).
